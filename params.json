  "body": "### Welcome to Parabola Flow Interactive!\r\nParabola Flow Interactive (or PFI) was initially developed by Wallace J. Morris II to investigate boundary layer flow phenomena, which he utilized in developing his theory for a universal prediction of airfoil stall onset.\r\n\r\n### Purpose \r\n* Serve as an algorithm testbed for later conversion into high-performance languages\r\n* Serve as a non-trivial, but simple, example of a CFD code -- even if it is limited to 2D incompressible flow\r\n* Serve as a benchmark of sorts for testing Matlab performance and language development (string arrays!)\r\n* Serve as an inspiration for those interested in using Matlab for their own simulation codes, even if they're not CFD\r\n\r\n### Vision\r\n* The code should emphasize clarity over performance.\r\n   * Minimal nested functions\r\n   * \r\n\r\n### Background Publications\r\nMorris, W.
